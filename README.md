# Ionic Audiobar

This component is derived from the UX pattern found in music applications such as Apple Music and Google Play Music.
It exposes an, "Audiobar" (think Navbar and Tabbar) that when interacted with exposes a detail view of the 
track currently playing.

This component is in the early stages of development and not recommended for use in a production application.

## Installation
`npm install ionic-audiobar`

## Usage
In most cases you'll want to use the Audiobar on your top level view so that it stays persistent across all views 
in your application.
